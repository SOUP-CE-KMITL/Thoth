# Thoth
Dynamic Resource Management for Platform-as-a-Service

# Abstact
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers often encounter fluctuated use of computing resources, leading to performance degradation. In order to maintain acceptable level of service quality, administrators may have to manually adjust the resource allocation as the workload changes. However, the manual approach will not scale for a large number of applications. As a result, we propose Thoth, a dynamic resource management system for PaaS using Docker container technology.  Thoth automatically monitors resource usage and dynamically adjusts appropriate amount of resources for each application.
